<ul>
  <li>📋 Checkbox selection for bank names</li>
  <li>💼 Fields for entering bank account details</li>
  <li>🗺️ Input fields for product or warehouse locations</li>
  <li>💳 Estimated banking services selection</li>
</ul>
A repeating attribute of an element in a semicircle in a rectangle with a flickering box shadow ensures an intuitive user interface.
User Dashboard
Authorized users can view their added products, select desired quantities, and manage sales. Sold quantities are subtracted from the main stock, and sales data is stored for monitoring purposes. This helps users control stock levels and keep an eye on the current balance.

Future Plans
The project is open for updates and new ideas. An updated version will be presented as the main README.md file.
