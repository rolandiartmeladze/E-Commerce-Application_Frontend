# My Full Stack E-Commerce Application

Welcome to my full stack e-commerce application! This project is built using React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose Atlas. It provides a platform for users to create accounts, add products, sell items online, manage inventory, search for products, and more.


 ### <h2 style="color: red;">An important note !!!</h2>

Because the main visual and functional details of the project are independently developed and implemented by me, which takes quite a lot of time and resources, so I try. Phased implementation of functional components Currently, the project does not include the possibility to buy or sell React Router, the product, sales log and order monitoring components. I am actively working on the implementation of these details in the project and the existing functional development
The ability to add a photo when creating a new product has not yet been defined.
The email validity function during registration is also not fully developed,
Comparison of upper and lower case characters during input
So during authorization, you must repeat the data specified during registration.

##### <span style="color:red;">You can enter the system with your registered email and password => </span>
 
<ul>
  <li><h4>Email: <samp>User@gmail.com</samp></h4></li>
  <li><h4>Pass: <samp>rolandi123</samp></h4></li>
</ul>
